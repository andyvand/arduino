#summary An overview of the platform architecture proposed for Arduino 1.0

There are multiple levels of organization:

  * _package_: a folder containing board definitions and code for one or more architectures
  * _platform_: a microcontroller architecture (e.g. AVR)

hardware/_PACKAGE_/_PLATFORM_/ contains (all targeting the containing platform):
  * boards.txt: board definitions
  * cores: one or more folders containing implementations of the Arduino API
  * libraries
  * platform.txt: build process definitions (e.g. compiler command-line arguments)
  * programmers.txt: programmer definitions
  * tools: the toolchain binaries
  * variants: one or more folders containing code specific to particular hardware variations
