#summary An overview of the platform architecture proposed for Arduino 1.0

There are multiple levels of organization:

  * _package_: a folder containing board definitions and code for one or more architectures
  * _platform_: a microcontroller architecture (e.g. AVR)
  * _core_: an implementation of the core Arduino API for a specific architecture

They are organized like this:

hardware/_PACKAGE_/_PLATFORM_/ contains (all targeting the containing platform):
  * boards.txt: board definitions
  * cores: one or more core folders
  * libraries
  * platform.txt: build process definitions (e.g. compiler command-line arguments)
