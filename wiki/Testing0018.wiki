#summary Test plan for Arduino 0018.

Help is welcome; try as many of these tests as you like.  Report your findings in the comments, including:
 * the operating system you tested on
 * on Linux, the versions of avr-gcc and avr-libc (for the core) or java (for the IDE) installed
 * the Arduino board you tested on
 * the test(s) attempted
 * the results

Comments and suggestions welcome, but may be better added to the [http://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/list issues list].

Things to test in the core:

 # Serial.end() - _ends serial communication and frees digital pins 0 and 1 for normal input and output._
  * test a: after a call to Serial.end(), can pins 0 and 1 be used for normal input and output?
  * test b: after a call to Serial.end(), will Serial.begin() re-enable serial communication?
  * test c: does Serial.end() work on all four Serial ports on the Arduino Mega?
 # tone() and noTone() - _frequency generation_
  * test a: does tone() generate a square wave w/ 50% duty cycle on any pin?
  * test b: does tone() generate the correct frequency (across multiple frequencies / timer prescale factors)?
  * test c: does the tone() end after the specified duration?
  * test d:
