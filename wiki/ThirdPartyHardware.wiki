= Details =

== Abstracting Hardware Definitions for Portable Libraries ==

See: [http://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/detail?id=59 Issue 59] for one potential solution.

== Supporting Custom Upload Processes and Tools ==

This can involve a custom version of avrdude (luminet), a custom upload tool (Teensy), or a custom Java class (luminet again).  There's a need to define a interface or API at one or more levels: e.g. Java class, command line, ant / make targets.

== Supporting Custom Compilation Processes and Tools ==

= To Do =
  # Support ATtiny (-mtXXX) in command line parameters to avrdude
  # Support for assembler (.S) files in cores and libraries
  # Support board definitions in individual files within SKETCHBOOK/boards
  # Support cores within SKETCHBOOK/cores
  # Support bootloaders within SKETCHBOOK/bootloaders
