= Details =

== Abstracting Hardware Definitions for Portable Libraries ==

See: [http://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/detail?id=59 Issue 59] for one potential solution.

== Supporting Custom Upload Processes and Tools ==

== Supporting Custom Compilation Processes and Tools ==

= To Do =
  # Support ATtiny (-mtXXX) in command line parameters to avrdude
  # Support for assembler (.S) files in cores and libraries
  # Support board definitions in individual files within SKETCHBOOK/boards
  # Support cores within SKETCHBOOK/cores
  # Support bootloaders within SKETCHBOOK/bootloaders
  # Abstract hardware definitions so libraries can work across cores and boards
  # Support for custom upload processes and external tools 
  # Support for custom compilation processes and external tools
